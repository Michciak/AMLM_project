# Procet for Advanced Machine Learning Methods

## Project Title: 

**Teaching Neural Networks to Play Snake Using Genetic Algorithms**

## Introduction:

It is description for the project "Teaching Neural Networks to Play Snake Using Genetic Algorithms" developed for the University subject AMLM. This project aims to explore the implementation of genetic algorithms to train neural networks to play the classic game of Snake.

## Project Overview:

In this project, I used a genetic algorithm approach to evolve neural network models capable of playing the game of Snake. The Snake game is a simple yet challenging environment where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, consuming food items while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls.

## Project Components:

- [X] Crate or get Snake like enviroment in Python.
